# trollz.exe
A piece of trollware I made in response when someone tried to get me to develop malware. (dont worry, I diddnt make them any malware).
It shows the henry stickmin distraction dance while playing rick roll in the background.
Im not gonna provide any info on how to customise it as tbf icba. It should be simple enough for even a script kid to figure out.
I would use electron builder when building it.
